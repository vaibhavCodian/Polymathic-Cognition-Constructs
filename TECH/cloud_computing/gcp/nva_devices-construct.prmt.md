## CORE MANDATE

### TASK: Architect, compare, and automate the deployment and management of NVA devices (Fortinet, Palo Alto, etc.) on GCP. Provide production-grade setup, CI/CD, troubleshooting, and code/configuration examples. Reference Cloud Foundation Fabric and vendor best practices for IaC and security.

## 1. WHAT IS AN NVA (NETWORK VIRTUAL APPLIANCE)?

- **NVA:** A virtualized network security device (firewall, IPS/IDS, proxy, etc.) deployed in the cloud to provide advanced traffic inspection, segmentation, and policy enforcement. Common vendors: Fortinet (FortiGate), Palo Alto (VM-Series), Check Point, Cisco, Sophos, etc.
- **Use Cases:**
  - Ingress/egress firewalling
  - East-west traffic inspection
  - Secure hybrid/multi-cloud connectivity
  - Application-layer threat prevention
  - VPN termination and SSL inspection

**Pros of NVAs:**
- Enterprise-grade security and compliance
- Deep packet inspection, advanced threat prevention
- Consistent policy enforcement across hybrid/multi-cloud
- Vendor-specific features (e.g., FortiGuard, WildFire)

**Cons of NVAs:**
- Higher cost and operational complexity
- May introduce network bottlenecks if not sized/scaled properly
- Requires ongoing patching and management

### Example: NVA Policy Deployment via CI/CD (Cloud Build)
```yaml
steps:
  - name: 'gcr.io/cloud-builders/gcloud'
    entrypoint: 'bash'
    args:
      - '-c'
      - |
        # Upload config to NVA via API/SSH
        scp ./firewall.conf admin@fortigate-nva:config/
        ssh admin@fortigate-nva 'execute config-import config/firewall.conf'
        # Add compliance check or post-deployment validation here
```

## 6. BEST PRACTICES & RECOMMENDATIONS
