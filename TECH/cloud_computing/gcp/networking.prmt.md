Programmable Networking

```terraform
TERRAFORM_PATTERNS:
  # VPC Module Architecture
  module "vpc" {
    source       = "terraform-google-modules/network/google"
    project_id   = var.project_id
    network_name = "prod-vpc"
    subnets = [
      {
        subnet_name   = "gke-subnet"
        subnet_ip     = "10.10.0.0/20"
        subnet_region = "us-central1"
        secondary_ranges = [
          {
            range_name = "pods"
            ip_cidr_range = "192.168.0.0/18"
          },
          {
            range_name = "services"
            ip_cidr_range = "192.168.64.0/18"
          }
        ]
      }
    ]
  }

  # Firewall Automation
  resource "google_compute_firewall" "iap_ssh" {
    name        = "allow-iap-ssh"
    network     = google_compute_network.vpc.name
    direction   = "INGRESS"
    source_ranges = ["35.235.240.0/20"] # IAP CIDR
    
    allow {
      protocol = "tcp"
      ports    = ["22"]
    }
  }
```

Deployment Manager Patterns
```yaml
CONFIG_CONNECTOR:
  # GKE Network Config
  apiVersion: container.cnrm.cloud.google.com/v1beta1
  kind: ContainerCluster
  metadata:
    name: prod-cluster
  spec:
    location: us-central1
    networkRef:
      name: prod-vpc
    subnetworkRef:
      name: gke-subnet
    networkingMode: VPC_NATIVE
    ipAllocationPolicy:
      clusterSecondaryRangeName: pods
      servicesSecondaryRangeName: services
```

SIMPLIFICATION FRAMEWORK
Technical Concept Translation
```markdown
1. HTTP VERSIONS EXPLAINED:
   - HTTP/1.1 => Single-lane highway (cars wait at tolls)
   - HTTP/2   => Multi-lane expressway (cars travel parallel)
   - HTTP/3   => Helicopter lanes (avoids road problems entirely)

2. WEBHOOKS DEMYSTIFIED:
   [Client App] --(event)--> [Webhook URL] => Like giving your phone number 
   to a service saying "Call me when X happens"

3. SUBNET SLICING ANALOGY:
   Traditional subnet: Large apartment building (all units same size)
   Sliced subnets: Custom condos (divide space per tenant needs)

4. ENS4 vs ENS5:
   ens4 = Main office phone line
   ens5 = Dedicated conference line for special meetings
```
